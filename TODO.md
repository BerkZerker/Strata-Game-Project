# TODO List

## Chunk Generation & Editing

- Move the generation code and the baking code from `world.gd` into a seperate generation file.
- Update the meshing code to handle different pixel types in the chunks and mesher.
- Add functions for editing terrain, but handle borders between chunks. Figure out a data-type (2d array?) to determine the shape of the edit.

## Texturing

- Learn shaders
