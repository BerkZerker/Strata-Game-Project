# TODO List

## Chunk Generation

- Move the generation code, and baking code from `world.gd` to `chunk.gd` and store the chunk data in the chunk.
- Handle different pixel types in the chunks and mesher.
- Add functions for editing terrain, but handle borders between chunks. Figure out a data-type (2d array?) to determine the shape of the edit.

## Texturing

- Learn shaders :)
